# Homework 2.2

The goal of this homework is to create a fully working Navbar with 3 different links using React Router and React Bootstrap. The pages that they link to can contain anything, even just simple header-tags. 

Notes:

- React Bootstrap is already installed and ready to go. You just need to figure out how to do the carousel. 
- React Router is also already installed and ready to use. **You will have to configure everything, but the Router package is installed.**

Tips:

- Don't forget `npm install` if you're attempting to run the application after cloning it!
- Don't forget to wrap the entire application using <BrowserRouter> in the index.js file!
- Don't forget to import the necessary React Bootstrap files!
